# Note

This folder contains the running code for DDA-GTN, divided into is one time 5-fold cross-validation, fivetimes 5-fold cross-validation, casestudy, data processing, and model.

# Contents

1 **MdataNW.py**：This file containing the code for running one time 5-cross validation for DDA-GTN. During the running of the code, log files are generated and stored in the saving_path/logi.txt.

2 **MdataNW_5cross.py**：This file containing the code for running 5 times 5-cross validation for DDA-GTN. During the running of the code, log files are generated and stored in the saving_path/logi.txt.

3 **casestudy_Mdata.py**：This file contains code for predicting new drug-disease associations.

4 **model.py**：This file contains the code for the Fast-GTN model.

5 **utils.py**：This file contains the function in the model implementation.

6 **inits.py**：This file contains the custom function in the model implementation.

7 **methods.py**：This file contains the function that calculates the average indicator value for the 50% discount cross validation.

8 **split.py**：This file generates the dataset used in training. The generated files will be stored in the Siridataset{i} folder.

9 **network.py**：This file contains the code for the DDA-GTN model.

10 **data_preprocessing.py**：This file generates the dataset used in training. The generated files will be stored in the dataset folder.

11 **negativesample.ipynb**：This file holds the process of randomly generating negative samples, and the results are saved in Data\NegativeSample.csv

12 **feature_ge_Cycle.py**: This file contains a loop to generate five five-fold cross-validated disease feature.The generated files will be stored in the feature0{i} folder. feature0{i} is a folder name that can be set when running the code, it can be changed to another name.
